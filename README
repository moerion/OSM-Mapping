Using http://www.openstreetmap.org/ to download a .XML map file and a DynusT data file, the python scripts will recreate the chosen map area in a 3d environment using Blender software.

The xml file will first be parsed to create a node list file and a link list file in csv (initially in xls but that caused problems later on). These will be the roads and intersections.

The links will then be split into segments that connect the nodes.

Lane information is imported for each link segment. The DynusT data did not work well with the OSM data so a default value of 4 lanes is given.

Now that all of the information has been collected and organized, the last script draws the roads in the blender environment.

I worked on this project while attending UNLV and working for the Transportation Research Center under Dr. Pushkin. Initially, the project was meant to allow for an exact replica of the Las Vegas area to be used for a driving simulator but it was later decided that it should be able to recreate any area chosen from the OSM database in a dynamic and fully automated way.

I was in charge of developing the initial graphics and interfacing Blender with the hardware controllers we used for the simulator.

I stopped working on the project after completing my share.
